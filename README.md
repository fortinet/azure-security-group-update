# Introduction
This Azure function works with a FortiGate Automation Action to change the security group of a requested VM to one specified in an environment variable.
This function uses Node.js and requires that the resource group be set as an environment variable.
It works by first fetching information on all the VMs in a resource group, querying their respective network cards and then their attached public IP addresses.

> **Note:** If you have more than one network card attached to a VM this function will not change the security group for all of them, only the network card with the associated IP address.

# Set up the Azure function

This function uses a service principal to authenticate. For details on setting up a service principal, refer to the Microsoft article [Create an Azure service principal with Node.js](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/azure/node-sdk-azure-authenticate-principal?view=azure-node-latest). Additional code samples can be found in the [Azure Github repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-node/blob/master/Documentation/Authentication.md).
