# Intro
This Azure Function works with a FortiGate Automation Action  to change the security group of a requested VM to one specified in an environment variable.
The function uses Node.js and requires that the resource group be set as an environment variable.
It works by first fetching information on all the VM's in a resource group, querying their respective network cards and then their attached Public IP Addresses.

    Note: If you have more than one network card attached to a VM this function will not change the security group of all of them, only the network card with the associated IP address.

# Set Up the Azure Function:
    This function uses Service Principal to authenticate, information on setting up a service principal can be found here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/azure/node-sdk-azure-authenticate-principal?view=azure-node-latest
    Additional coding samples can be found here: https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-node/blob/master/Documentation/Authentication.md

  1. Create a Function APP and select JavaScript as the Runtime Stack
