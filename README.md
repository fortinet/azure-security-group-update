# Introduction
This Azure function works with a FortiGate Automation Action to change the security group of a requested VM to one specified in an environment variable.
This function uses **Node.js** and requires that the Resource Group be set as an environment variable.
It works by first fetching information on all the VM's in a Resource Group, querying their respective network cards and then their attached Public IP Addresses.

> **Note:** If you have more than one network card attached to a VM this function will not change the security group for all of them, only the network card with the associated IP Address.

# Set Up the Azure Function
This function uses a service principal to authenticate. Information on setting up a service principal can be found in the Microsoft article [Create an Azure service principal with Node.js](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/azure/node-sdk-azure-authenticate-principal?view=azure-node-latest). Additional code samples can be found in the [Azure Github repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-node/blob/master/Documentation/Authentication.md).

  1. In the Azure portal, create a **Function App**. Set the **Runtime Stack** to **JavaScript**.

     1. Select **Create a resource** from the upper left-hand corner.
     2. Click **Compute** and then **Function App**.
     3. Under **Runtime Stack**, select **JavaScript**.
     4. Select **Windows** as the backend.
	 4. Click **Create**.
  2. Create a function in the new function app. Set the **Authorization Level** to **Function**.
     1. Expand the new function app.
	 2. Click the **+** button next to **Functions**.
	 3. If this is the first time you have created a function, click **In-portal** and then **Webhook + API**. To set the **Authorization Level**, expand the newly created function and click **Integrate**. If this is not the first function to be created, click **HTTP trigger**.
	 4. Under **Authorization Level**, select **Function**.
  4. Install dependencies by uploading the provided `package.json` and running `npm install` in the **Console** window of the function. Alternatively, install them individually:
     * `ms-rest-azure`
     * `azure-arm-network`
     * `azure-arm-compute`
  5. Replace the template code with the provided `index.js`. Alternatively, deploy using Visual Studio.
  6. Select the function app and click **Application settings**.
  7. Under **Application settings** add the following:

     * **SUBSCRIPTION_ID:** Your Subscription ID
     * **RESOURCE_GROUP:** The Resource Group in which the VMs are located
     * **TENANT_ID:** Domain Or Tenant ID
     * **REST_APP_ID:** Client or App ID
     * **REST_APP_SECRET:** Password or Secret
     * **QUARANTINE_SECURITY_GROUP:** The Network Security Group you want to use to quarantine VMs

# Set Up the FortiGate

  1. Set up your FortiGate by selecting **Security Fabric** and then **Automation**.
  2. Select **Compromised Host** as the **Trigger**.
  3. Select **Azure Function** as the **Action**.
